### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 Part 2 was one of my favorite programming projects due to its engaging implementation of a simple guessing game using C++. I liked designing the game logic within the GameState class and learned about incorporating randomness effectively with the RandomSecretNumber function. I learned that the code structure provided insight into managing game states and utilizing random number generation for interactive applications.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 Part 1 was one of my most memorable programming projects as it was it was my first lab involving a math equation. Although it was a fairly simple projcet it was also one of the most diffucult for me as I was new to programming and everything was forign to me. This was also the first lab where I had to impliment a solution.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was a very engaging project to work on with my partners. This project gave insights to error handling, string manipulation, and argument parsing. It aswell demonstrated error handling through conditional statements Using all these methods to create a game of blackjack gave this project a real world aspect.
